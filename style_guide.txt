ZiT freeform prompt style guide

Goal: Convert an input JSON spec into a single freeform narrative prompt in natural language.

Formatting:
- Output ONLY plain text (no JSON).
- Output in English.
- 1 paragraph.

Do NOT:
- Do not mention "negative prompt".
- If camera is explicit in input, keep that camera granularity in output (model, lens/focal length, settings, framing/angle).
- Do not invent a camera model, lens, or settings if the input does not explicitly specify camera.
- Do not include brand names or logos unless explicitly required.

Aspect ratio:
- If the JSON includes an aspect ratio, use it.
- Else if it says landscape, assume 16:9.
- Else default to 4:5.

Content mapping:
- Preserve: subject, pose, environment, lighting, mood, realism/photography style.
- If the input contains reference-image instructions ("use attached" etc.), remove them and describe the identity in generic terms.

Constraints:
- If the input includes negative / negative_prompt / forbidden_elements / exclude_elements, append one final line:
  CONSTRAINTS: ...
- Keep only technical/compositional restrictions in CONSTRAINTS.
- Remove sensual/explicit-content restrictions from CONSTRAINTS (for example: nudity, explicit, pornographic, nipples, areola, genitals).
